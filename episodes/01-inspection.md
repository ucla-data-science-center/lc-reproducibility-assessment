teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "Why inspect the code?"
- "What is the purpose of code comments?"
- "What is code header metadata, and why is it important?"
- "What is a Main File, and why is it important?"
objectives:
- "To understand the importance of code comments for reproducibility"
- "To understand the importance of code header metadata for reproducibility"
- "To understand what a Main File is and how it contributes to reproducibility"
keypoints:
- "A Main File is an essential piece of code supplementing a README file and often the starting point in a fully automated push-button replication.  A must-have in reproducibility packages that have more than one program file."
- "Code header metadata signals to re-users the code authorsâ€™ transparency and willingness to be contacted, identifies the appropriate computing environment to run the analysis, and permission to use the code(s)."
